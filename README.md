# My Personal Website and Blog

Hi !
Welcome to my blog as well as personal website.

## About the Blog

I created this blog to describe some common challenges in designing, maintaing and deploying Machine Learning Projects.
This blog is practical oriented, written to understand how things can be done efficiently.
Thank you for spending your time !

## About the Website

This is my personal portofolio website, which I will keep updating as time and life progreses.
This was built using Jekyll. Which makes it very easy to maintain.

The website uses Minimal mistakes [template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate)
which gives this website the pleasant formatting.
