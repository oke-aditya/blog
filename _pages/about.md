Hello! I'm Aditya Oke, currently an undergrad student at [Vellore Institue of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), India.

My interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and DevOps.
I work mostly with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), 

Do let me know comments and feedback for blog [here](https://github.com/oke-aditya/me).

## My Projects

All Projects are available on my GitHub profile.

A brief overview about my top projects.

### [Quickvision](https://github.com/Quick-AI/quickvision): -

An easy to use Computer Vision Library for PyTorch and Lightning.
A simple API for transfer learning SOTA Models.

### [Image Similarity Search Engine](https://github.com/oke-aditya/image_similarity): -

Implementation of Image Similarity Search using convolutional auto-encoders.
[Here](https://medium.com/pytorch/image-similarity-search-in-pytorch-1a744cf3469) is blog post about it from PyTorch.

### [PyTorch CNN Trainer](https://github.com/oke-aditya/pytorch_cnn_trainer): -

An easy to use CNN trainer. Supports PyTorch lightning and easy transfer learning.

### [PyFresh](https://github.com/oke-aditya/py_fresh): -

A template to quickly create Python Projects.
Built in with Documentation, CI testing and PyPi package deployment.

## I contribute to open source !

I'm an open source contributor and have contributed to many repos [Torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision), 
[PyTorch Lightning Bolts](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning-bolts) to name a few.
