<p>Machine Learning Projects are hard to make. Maintaining them is even much harder.
Code becomes complex and end of month or year, it becomes impossible to understand it.</p>

<h2 id="but-why-do-projects-become-spaghetti-code-">But Why do projects become spaghetti code ?</h2>

<h3 id="lack-of-project-structure">Lack of project structure</h3>

<p>Projects that lack structure intially later become a mess. Usually this occurs when all code is dumped into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> folder.
This folder gets highly polluted and later it becomes hard to understand the codebease.
It is wise to divide codebase into folders and sub folders, which make it easier to understand code.</p>

<h3 id="not-documenting-the-code-or-work">Not documenting the code or work</h3>

<p>Code that looks obvious right now becomes very hard to understand later.
Remember that code written should be re-usable and accessible to all people.
Easy methods such as type hinting, Docstrings are sufficient and make code clear.</p>

<p>E.g. We write a function that takes a tuple denoting rectangle in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(x, y, w, h)</code> format.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">l</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">l</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">l</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above code is ok, but if we hadn’t written what it does, it would be hard to understand.
Let’s make this function better</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">area_rect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Tuple</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="s">"""
  Arguments:
    rect (Typle): A tuple denoting rectangle in (x, y, w, h)
    format. Where x, y are cordinates and w, h are width
    and height.
  Returns (Int):
    Area of rectangle.
  """</span>
  <span class="n">area</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">area</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>How simple yet so powerful can docuemnting be !</p>

<h3 id="missing-requirements-not-specifing-how-to-use-the-project">Missing requirements, not specifing how to use the project</h3>

<p>These are small additions, such as having a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code> file can help people to replicate your computer packages.
Which would enable them to stay consistent with your work.</p>

<p>Having a proper <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Readme</code> which describes how the projects is structured and how it should be run is really helpful.
It helps people to replicate your code and try it for their work.</p>

<h3 id="not-using-functions">Not using functions</h3>

<p>Many people work without writing functions. This does not make code modular and harder to comprehend.
Having functions with docstrings and using them keeps content clear and easier to understand.
Writing functions on top of file and calling in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> is easier. E.g. let’s call the above area function.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"__main__"</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">rect</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">];</span>
  <span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">area_rect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="over-engineering">Over Engineering</h3>

<p>Well all the above examples are use cases of under engineering or not following simple practices.
But at cases, people try to do too much and re-invent the wheel. There are multiple well supported and documented libraries available.
Try to use those and their methods, most functions are already present and work really well.</p>

<p>That’s all for this blog! Hopefully your next project doesn’t become a spaghetti code!</p>]]></content><author><name>Aditya Oke</name></author><category term="Machine Learning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why Machine Learning Projects become code spaghetti?]]></summary></entry></feed>
