Machine Learning Projects are hard to make. Maintaining them is even much harder.
Most projects usually are not maintainable after a few weeks or say a few months.
This usually happens for pet projects or projects made by students. I too have faced such hurdles and can give a few reasons why it occurs so.

1. Lack of project structure: -

Projects that lack structure intially later become a mess. Usually this occurs when all code is dumped into a `src` folder.
This folder gets highly polluted and later it becomes hard to understand the codebease.
It is wiser to divide codebase into folders and sub folders, which make it easier to understand code.

2. Not documenting the code or work : -

Code that looks obvious right now becomes very hard to understand later.
Remember that code written should be re-usable and accessible to all people.
Easy methods such as type hinting, Docstrings are sufficient and do make code clear.

E.g.

3. Missing requirements, not specifing how to use the project: - 

These are small additions, such as having a `requirements.txt` file can help people to replicate your computer packages.
Which would enable them to stay consistent with your work.

Having a proper Readme which describes how the projects is structured and how it should be run is really helpful.
It helps people to replicate your code and try it for their work.
