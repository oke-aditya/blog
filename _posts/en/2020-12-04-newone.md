## Introduction

Machine Learning Projects are hard to make. Maintaining them is even much harder.
Code becomes complex and end of month or year, it becomes impossible to understand it.

## But Why do projects become spaghetti code ?

### Lack of project structure

Projects that lack structure intially later become a mess. Usually this occurs when all code is dumped into a `src` folder.
This folder gets highly polluted and later it becomes hard to understand the codebease.
It is wiser to divide codebase into folders and sub folders, which make it easier to understand code.

### Not documenting the code or work
